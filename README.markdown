# SimMizzou

I'm throwing this up on the internet because "why not." This is was a learning project when I was new to programming, and I thought it would be fun to open-source it. YOU ARE WARNED.

## Background

This was a final project for a undergrad graphics course that I worked on with John Loyd. The humor is dated and filled with in-jokes that only a Mizzou student circa 2003 could enjoy. The graphics are rotten but were fun to hack together in OpenGL.

The code is pretty terrible too with some mega classes sprinkled here and there. Not my greatest accomplishment, but I did have a _really_ good time working on this with John.

## Playing the Game

So technically this is a "game" about "building a college." I can't really stand behind either of those two claims today, but I will take credit for the fact that the original executables still run on a modern Windows machine. As soon as I figure out how to build this project from source again (see below), I'll make it available in other formats.

Hopefully the interface is relatively intuitive. Click-and-hold the right mouse button to move around.

## Building from Source

Good luck. The code requires the GLaux library which seems to have been removed from the internet after humanity collectively agreed that it sucked around 2004 or so. Also, this library requires  FLTK 1.0103 which I'm not finding anywhere on the internet either. So, er, sorry about that.

## Artwork

Nearly all the artwork used within was made by John and Scott or comes from the publicly-available ["Golgotha Textures"](http://www.wolfiesden.com/golgotha/golgotha.asp)

You can tell the two apart because everything we made is immediately offensive to the eye.
