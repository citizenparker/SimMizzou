<p align="center"><b><a name="Installation">1. Installation</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To install SimMizzou, simply unzip the SimMizzou.zip file
to the directory of your choice. Then, in that directory, just run the program
&quot;SimMizzou.exe&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><b><a name="Idea">2. The Big Idea </a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of anyone at the top is to remain at the top as
long as possible. In your situation, it's to do a good job of running the
University so as to build our programs and your reputation. Grow successful
programs, make students happy, and you'll be loved. Run the budget into the
ground, and fail to please the students, and you might just be looking for
another job.</p>
<p align="center"><b><a name="Interface">3. The Interface</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon starting SimMizzou, you'll be presented with
the SimMizzou main interface. This is how you'll control your University in
addition to adjusting game parameters and loading / saving games. At all times,
the right mouse button will pan the camera around and the middle mouse button
will zoom in and out. Under the File menu are options for starting a new game,
loading or saving a game in progress, and quitting a game. Click the help button
for in-game info on how to play SimMizzou in addition to features that were
unavailable at the printing of this document. See below for a screenshot and
explanation of features</p>
<p><b>Part A - </b>The Toolbox The toolbox contains almost all the info you'll
use to interact with your university. From top to bottom, the toolbox contains
the following information: </p>
<p>1. Your Name: Who is running our fine university? You can change your name
here if you desire. <br>
2. Your approval rating: Drop too low for too long and you'll face a vote of no
confidence. <br>
3. Current Budget Surplus: How much money, after maintaining buildings and
programs, which you have to spend on improvements. If this drops, your approval
will drop too and then you're out of a job, poncho. <br>
4. Date: Keep track of how long you've been running the show</p>
<p>5&amp;6. Building Type &amp; Price: The type of building displayed and the
price of it. <br>
7. Place Mode Button: Changes the mouse cursor to attempt to place buildings
with a left click <br>
8. Select Mode Button: Change the cursor to select building with a left click,
after which they are the active building in the &quot;Building Info&quot;
portion of the toolbox (see blow) <br>
9. Lower Terrain Mode: Change the cursor to select a vertex of land to lower, on
left click. <br>
10. Raise Terrain Mode: Change the cursor to select a vertex of land to raise,
on left click.</p>
<p>11. Building Name: The name of the currently selected building. You can
change it if you desire (in fact, you should) <br>
12. Date Completed: Self-explanatory. Come on. <br>
13. Type: An abbreviated version of the building type. <br>
14. Upgrade Level: The number of times the building has been upgraded <br>
<b><br>
Part B</b> - The Play Area The play area is where you'll see the graphical
representation of all that you do. Buildings are placed in the play area and can
be manipulated there. In addition, you'll notice the changing seasons here as
well. The ground can be raised using either the raise or lower vertex buttons In
addition, the camera can be moved using the right and middle mouse buttons. <br>
</p>
<p align="left"><b>Part C</b> - The Opinion Box Likely the most important part
of the game screen, the opinion box lets you know what the students are thinking
and feeling. The higher the &quot;% Agreeing&quot; is on the opinion, the more
urgently it needs to be taken care of. The surveys are done each month, and so
are only updated in-between months, so don't expect it to change
instantaneously. This will always show the most urgent item on the minds of
students. If it's not very important, feel free to ignore it.</p>
<p align="center"><b><a name="Tips">4. Tips &amp; Tricks</a></b></p>
<p>- Always make sure you have enough dorms for your students, and that they're
well distributed across campus. Long walks make for unhappy students<br>
- Cluster related buildings together. For example, an Engineering building will
draw more money the closer it is to a Physics building. Journalism students want
to be close to the Library. Ag students, conversely, don't want to be next to
any other types of school buildings (they want land for Ag stuff)<br>
&nbsp;- Upgrading building allows you to double the output of a building for
less than it costs to build a new building entirely - Demolishing is expensive
in real life, and so you can't get money from tearing a building down, you just
stop losing money on expenses for it<br>
&nbsp;- IATS is a very, very unpopular service.<br>
&nbsp;- If you want to cheat, check out the saved games in .smu format. It's
pretty easy.<br>
&nbsp;- Changing the terrain is nice, but not very effective.<br>
&nbsp;- Students aren't ever very happy. Even if nothing is wrong and they
should kiss your feet for your managerial skills, they won't have much to say
about you. </p>
